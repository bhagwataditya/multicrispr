This new BioC package makes the design of CRISPR-APEX experiments easier.
Serving to the specifics of such experiments, these functions:
1. Find a CRISPR set to target a genomic set.
2. Allow to target the flanks of genomic loci rather than the loci themselves.
3. Are efficient, relying on data.table and Biostrings.
