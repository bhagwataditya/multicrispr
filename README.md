# Introduction

crisprapex makes the design of CRISPR-APEX experiments easier.
Serving to the specifics of such experiments, these functions:

* Find a CRISPR **set** to target a genomic **set**.
* Allow to target the **flanks** of genomic loci rather than loci themselves.
* Are **efficient**, building on top of data.table and Biostrings.
