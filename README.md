# Introduction

This package is designed to make the design of CRISPR-APEX experiments easier.
\newline
Such These experiments often require:

* finding a CRISPR **set** to target a genomic **set**.
* targeting the **flanks** of genomic loci rather than loci themselves.
* **efficient** functions, which are provided by building on top of 
    data.table and Biostrings.
